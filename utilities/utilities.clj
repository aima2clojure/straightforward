  "Basic utility functions and macros, used throughout the AIMA Common Lisp code.
  Some, if not most, may not be needed with Clojure.

  The utilities are divided into control flow macros, list
  utilities, functions for 2-dimensional points, numeric utilities,
  some trivial functions, utilities for strings, symbols and
  printing, a debugging tool, and a testing tool.

  In general, Common Lisp names and algorithms have been preserved except for
  name conflicts and the optimization of Clojure for vectors over seqs,
  which are the Clojure generalization of the Clojure list type."

;;; The AIMA Common Lisp macros "while", "for", "dotimes", and "deletef"
;;; are not translated.  "define-if-undefined" should not be used as is.
;;; The Clojure "@" read macro conflict is resolved with "make-xy".
;;; The AIMA function "sample-without-replacement" has a different algorithm
;;; that takes advantage of the Java runtime environment.

;;;; Control Flow Macros

;;; We define iteration macros to match the book's pseudo-code.
;;; This could all be done with LOOP, but some users don't have
;;; the LOOP from the 2nd edition of 'Common Lisp: the Language'.

;;; Clojure "while" is a macro with the same semantics as Common Lisp AIMA.

;;; Clojure "for" and "doseq" are macros that do the operations
;;; of the AIMA Common Lisp "for-each" macro but without the noise (in do) args.
;;; Since the core Clojure "for" and "doseq" macros have
;;; a standard, idomatic syntax, no Clojure "for-each" macro is defined.

;;; Clojure "dotimes" is a macro that does the operations of the AIMA Common Lisp
;;; "for" macro but without the noise (= to do) args.
;;; Since Clojure has a core "for" macro, no Clojure macro is defined.

;;; Clojure uses "filter", "filterv", "disj", or "dissoc" to produce a new
;;; immutable collection instead of destructively altering a sequence
;;; like AIMA Common Lisp "deletef".
;;; Any "deletef" usage should be checked for side effects.
